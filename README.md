In the name of Allah

## A modified version of my [C# verb anaylzer](https://github.com/rasoolims/PersianVerbAnalyzer)

The following package consists of a rule-based verb inflector in Persian developed by [Mohammad Sadegh Rasooli](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rasooli/). The code was mainly used for preprocessing the [Persian dependency treebank](http://dadegan.ir/en).
